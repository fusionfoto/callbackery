<%= $p->{class} %> is a cool web application.

You are looking at a template for creating a Qooxdoo application with
a Mojolicious backend. It is a classic "configure - make - install" setup.

Prerequisite
------------

Get a copy of the Qooxdoo sdk from www.qooxdoo.org.  If you followed the
"Quickstart" on https://github.com/oetiker/qx-mojo-app you are already set
with a copy of the Qooxdoo sdk in $HOME/sdk/qooxdoo-4.0.1-sdk.  In this case
immediately proceed with "Setup".

Setup
-----

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/<%= $p->{name} %> --with-qooxdoo-sdk=$HOME/sdk/qooxdoo-4.0.1-sdk

Configure will check if the necessary items are in place and give
hints on how to fix the situation if something is missing.

Development
-----------

While developing the application it is conveniant to NOT have to install it
before runnning. You can actually serve the Qooxdoo source directly
using the built-in Mojo webserver.

  cd frontend && make source
  cd bin
  ./<%= $p->{name} %>-source-mode.sh daemon

You can now connect to the Mojolicious server with your web browser.

If you need any additional perl modules, write their names into the PERL_MODULES file.

Installation
------------

To install the application, just run

   make install

You can now run <%= $p->{name} %>.pl in reverse proxy mode.

Packaging
---------

Before release, make sure to update CHANGES, VERSION and run ./bootstrap

You can also package the application as a nice tar.gz file, containing a stipped
down copy of cpan, so that all perl modules can be rebuilt at the destination.
If you want to make sure that your project builds with perl 5.10.1, make sure to
set PERL to a perl 5.10.1 interpreter, remove your thirdparty directory and configure again. Now all
modules to make your project fly with an old perl will be included in the distribution.

   make dist
